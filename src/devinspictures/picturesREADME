Compile cubes.c.  Make the directory "all54".  Running the executable from cubes.c followed by ./makecube.R with no arguments will make the pictures and put them in "all54".

Next, compile cubes.c with the macro "FILTER" defined.  Make the directory "special20".  Running the executable from cube.c followed by './makecube.R FILTER' will make the pictures and put them in "special20"
