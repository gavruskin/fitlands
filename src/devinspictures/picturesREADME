Compile cubes.c.  Make the directory "all54".  Running the executable fills
all54 with text files consisting of a matrix representation of non-cyclic
directed graphs on the cube modulo graph isomorphism.

Next, compile cubes.c with the macro "FILTER" defined. Make the directory
"special20".  Running the executable fills special20 with the graphs satisfying
the "Dyck" condition. 

Then run makecube.R with and without the argument "FILTER" to get the pictures.
