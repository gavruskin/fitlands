Please compile cubes.c with FILTER as a defined macro, as in 

gcc ... -DFILTER -o a.out

Otherwise, you will get the wrong graphs.  The executable from cubes.c makes
twenty files of the form mats*.  These are just text files containing the
matrix representations of the desired graphs.  Then run makecubes.R to produce
the pictures which have the form cubes*.ps.  The R package 'diagram' is
required to make the pictures.
